SkyliteDC++ is a cross-platform program that uses the Direct Connect and ADC
protocols. It is compatible with other DC clients, such as the original DC from

DC hub software.

The minimum number of our patches to original DC++ kernel makes it easy to
upgrade to new versions and ensures compatibility with other clients.
Unfortunately, the number of patches is growing...
